**100_bpm_rescue** (Japanese Title: リズムでレスキュー) is an educational application designed to help children learn the correct rhythm for CPR (Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation) through an interactive experience.

Overview
--------

The primary goal of this application is to teach the optimal rhythm for chest compressions (100 bpm) in a gamified way.

**Users hold the smartphone and perform actual chest compression motions.** The app uses the **accelerometer** to detect the movement, allowing users to physically internalize the tempo and effort required for life-saving activities.

Target Audience
---------------

**Primary Target:**
- 5th-grade elementary school students (approx. 10-11 years old).

**Why this age?**
- 10 years old is generally considered the age when children develop the physical strength necessary to perform effective chest compressions.
